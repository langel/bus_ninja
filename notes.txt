practical notes from the 48 hours

6 hours in I feel hopelessly lost, like a baby who's mum's breast had drowned
in the vapid wastelands of rivers full of drown-ed babies.  The flesh torn
across of time and space in the recesses of b'ulgriandohr.  To not say it is
for the next of the kin all are beyond tis the semblence of all.

6 hours in --

I realize a concept such as developing a game engine compartmentalized away
from the game itself is beset with the chaos of time betrayed.  I must 
sojourne into simpler couplings.  A counterpart declared my work reminded
themselves of great company at the basin of Mt. Fuji.  The luscious colors
of two score ago, achieved septalogically across binary stars that are the 
rhythmic display renderd by cathrodic ray casting mechanisms.

Versions must be controlled.  The scope that of which can be flexed.  In all
my days have I nost considered the seloquancy of tipid whosits and whatsons.
